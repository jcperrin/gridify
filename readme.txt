This program is an introduction to photo manipulation in python.
It's inspired by a photo that I saw on the internet today
describing how computer vision works. In it, the author
uses a photo of his son, broken into smaller panes and spread out
in order to illustrate the idea of a computer looking at sub-secitons
of a photo in order to apply machine learning to it.

The frames were of overlapping parts of the source image, but
were spread out such that the composite had the effect of looking
through a kaleidescope or compound eyes.

This program is meant to take any photo, and to appply the same effect
to it. It will eventually prompt the user both for the type of grid
and/or the columns and rows but for now I'm just getting functionality
up and running for a set number of rows.

You can find the original photo here:
